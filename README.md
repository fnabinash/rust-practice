# Rust Practice

A collection of 240+ exercises to learn and practice building production-grade CLI tools in Rust.

After cloning the repo to your local machine delete the [Instrcutions](#instructions) & [folder structure](#folder-structure) section. It is just to guide you on "How to fork, clone and practice exercise?".

## Instructions

To practice and track your progress, follow these steps.

1. Fork the Repo.
2. Clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rust-practice.git
cd rust-practice
```

3. Switch to the practice branch.

```bash
git switch practice
```

4. Do exercises.

Before you start doing exercises, I recomend you to read `00-must-read-before-practice` file. ([link](./00-must-read-before-practice/practice.md)).

That file gives you the clear instructions "How to do exercises effecticely?".

5. Track your progress.

After succesfully completing a exercise, tick the exercise on this `README.md` file.

For example, you just finished the first exercise of `hello-world`, to mark it done;

- Go to `README.md` file
- Navigate to first exercise
- replace the space with `X` i.e. [ ] become [X].

## Folder Structure

This repo is divided into 3 types of folders.

1. **Levels**
    - Level indicates the difficulty of exercises.
    - e.g. Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Projects
2. **Topics**
    - Each level contains multiple topics.
    - Each topic is a cargo workspace.
    - e.g. `variables`, `functions`, `enums`, `traits` ...
3. **Exercises**
    - Each topic contains 10 exercises.
    - Each exercise is a member of that workspace.
    - e.g. `variables_01`, `variables_02`, `variables_03` ...

### Other Folders and Files

1. **Image Folder**
    - It contains images that are used in the `README.md` file.
2. **Quick Links**
    - Quick links is a file, that contains links to solutions for all exercises(i.e. links to `src/main.rs`).
